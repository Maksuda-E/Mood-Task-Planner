1.	Project Title: Mood-Task Planner
2.	Problem Statement / Objective:
The majority of task management prefer or organize tasks based on their deadlines, but they overlook for the impact of an individual's energy level or mood on their productivity. People frequently find it difficult to finish projects because they are mentally unprepared for high-effort job, exhausted, or under stress. Procrastination and decreased productivity are frequently the results of this. This project aims to develop a task management system based on user’s emotion that enables users to select tasks according to their energy level such as high, medium, and low. People will be able to work easily and efficiently if tasks are matched to their emotional condition. In the future, this concept will allow for improved time management, increase productivity, and help users in developing positive work habits.
3.	Scope of the project:
This project allows users to add and view tasks according to their energy level or mood. Users will be able to add tasks to the system, see them by mood category, and mark them as finished. The goal of this project is to create an effective and engaging system, with future chances to add additional features.

4.	 Methodology / Planning:
To do this project, Python and SQLite will be used to develop the functionality and store the data. Users will be able to add tasks, view tasks according to their energy level or mood, and record activities as finished through the consol based user interface. Python basics like loops, functions, and conditional statements will be used to write the main logic. A local database for task storage will be created and maintained using the sqlite3 library. To make sure tasks are added, viewed, and updated correctly, each functionality will be tested. 

5.	Resources Required:
•	Python 3 
•	SQLite database 
•	Since all task data will be created by the user and kept locally, no external datasets or APIs are needed.



6.	Final Output:
The final output of this project will be the following functionalities:
•	User account creation and login by using username and password.
•	Every user will have their own task list.
•	Add/Create task by category based on user mood (High, Medium, Low).
•	Users can view task by category.
•	Edit and delete task.
•	Users can mark task as completed.
•	View a list of completed tasks.
•	View information about total task and completed task.
•	Store and retrieve all task using the SQLite database.
